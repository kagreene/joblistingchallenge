## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

This project helped reinforce my understanding of fundamental CSS techniques, like the use of flexbox to build responsive and well-aligned components. It also strengthened my grasp on using React to modularize UI into reusable components and managing application states with hooks to dynamically update the job-search filters. Throughout the build process, I strengthened my debugging skills by resolving subtle layout issues in the browser. 

### Continued development

 - Flexbox for responsive layout
 - React to manage states 
 - Responsive design
